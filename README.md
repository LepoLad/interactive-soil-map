# Makalii Metrics Interactive Soil Map

### One interactive map displaying soil order and series data for the entire Pae Aina o Hawaii

The idea is for make this buggah come all pretty and cherreh and then put em on top the Makalii Metrics website for people to play with.
We like it be one resource for people to explore the depth of soil science in Hawaii, inspire curiosity about soils, and also one tool for us to use internally 
for when we go do soil sampling work or community outreach kine stuff. The map webpage should communicate information about soil types in a way that is effective 
and interesting for people who no more technical backgrounds. 

soil orders stay color-coded and can be filtered with one dropdown selector. Soil series name gets displayed when the user clicks on one spot.

poly_files/ contains all the json files for the script to pull from when adding polygons to the map. Those stay cherreh already, no need mess with it I just hosted it here for make it all live in one place.
